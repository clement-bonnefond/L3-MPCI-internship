# L3-MPCI-internship
You will find here the algorithms developed during my L3 MPCI internship.
The Apriori file is used to run the Apriori algorithm. You need to import a CSV file and change the dimensions in the first for loop to match the dimensions of your table.
The Dataset file is used to build the input to Utilisation_V2.
The Codev2 file contains the functions needed to run Utilisation_V2.

You can find below a decision tree to help you understand all the possible uses of Utilisation_V2.
